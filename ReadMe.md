<center>**Ecommerce Website: Online Book Shop**</center>

**Abstract:**
<p>
Our aim is to make an E-Commerce website. A book store where you can buy any book from any publisher any time you want to. The age old brick mortar book store is slowly fading away while online e-Commerce sites like amazon.com, rokomari.com, boibazar.com, skyo.com etc. are thriving. An E-Commerce site like these is a goldmine of a business opportunity and now-a-days people&#39;s interest in books have not degraded. In fact, the interest of having the smell and feeling of a physical book at your hands has increased.
</p>


# **Introduction**

**Background and Motivation:**

<p>After browsing a couple of websites like skyo.com, rokomari.com, boibazar.com we come to realize that they aim to create the best possible online bookshop. Especially BoiBazar and Rokomari which target our Bangladeshi markets. Our motivation was to compete in this market to make the best online bookshop for Bangladeshis. </p>

**Project Goal:**

<p>The objective of our project is to make an E-Commerce website. A book store where you can buy any book from any publisher any time you want to. With essential features for publishers and writers and customers.</p>

<p>Here is the list of all the promised features we have been able to implement within the given time.</p>

**Technical Details**

**Tools used:**

<p>Implementing our project, we have used:</p>

<li>Php (Laravel Framework)</li>
<li>Html,css, javascript(front end) </li>
<li>MySQL Database.</li>

**Database Module:**

**Implementation:**

<p>At first, we started by brushing up our knowledge in the various subjects and the first thing we did was create the Database for books while simultaneously working on our Front-end of the website. In the homepage of our website you can see the books that available for the customers to buy. And If clicked on each, every book has its own page of description, Price, title and Reviews. Whilst that was going we made sure the back-end work of various features was going on. Gradually, we added the various features such as the Unique User Account feature and Publisher features where every publisher can track their books, add new books, see how many they have sold, delete any book if they are no longer in stock. Or inform us that more stock is available and so on. Any change the publisher makes on their end is simultaneously updates in the homepage and the Database. We also have the Shopping cart and Checkout feature where any customer can add any book they like to their shopping cart by clicking on the &#39;add to cart&#39; button. They can add as many different books as they like also as many copies of those books as they want to. Providing that stock of that book is available. If Stock of that book is not available, that customer will be informed with a message Only 1 left in stock. The &#39;buy now&#39; button proceeds the customer to checkout.</p>

# **Project Summary**

**Result and Discussion:**

<p>In our Website we see that the database has been fully fledged and is working as intended. The homepage and Publisher Dashboard updates accordingly. The Checkout Feature Buy now feature could not fully implemented because we did not have enough time to create a gateway for BKash or VISA or MasterCard so that the transaction can be completed. The Search feature could not be implemented due to a lack of time. Nevertheless, all the other features of our website has been optimized and is working as promised. </p>
